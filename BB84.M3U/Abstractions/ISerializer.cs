	/// Lines starting with <c>#EXTINF:</c> are treated as metadata for the next entry, while lines starting with
	/// <c>#EXTGRP:</c> specify grouping information. Non-comment lines are interpreted as file paths for playlist entries.

	/// <remarks>
	/// The serialized string includes the M3U header, global attributes such as `url-tvg`, `cache`,
	/// `deinterlace`, and `refresh` (if set), and a list of entries. Each entry includes metadata
	/// (e.g., duration, title, group information) and the file path. The output adheres to the extended
